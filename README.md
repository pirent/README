# Phuc's README
🚧 Work in progress 🚧

## Motivation

This documents serves as an introduction about me and my management style. I will also share my personalities applied at workplace, what I value, and what I expect from my teammates when working with me. This will help you understand me better since I've just started my journey as a manager recently 😉
 
The primary audiences for this document are my pool members, but can be used by anyone that wants to know how I work. Feedback is welcome.

## My Role
Helping you grow as an individual, to achieve your goals and career path 🐣🐤🐥🎉. But my job is _not_ to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. I just give you advice, and decisions are made on your own.

## What I value most
- **Transparency** 💎: I will always try to be as transparent as I can with you. I am hoping you will be the same with me.
- **Privacy** 🔕: I often embrace solitude to pursue my own interests rather than seeking out social activity.
- **Ownership** 🚩: when you feel proud about your work, impress me, then you gain my respect and care.
- **Honest and direct feedback** 🗨️: we are adults, and we are here to work professionally, not as a cheerleader.

## Expectation
I won't tell you how to manage your time or how to do your work **unless** you explicitly ask for it, you are the expert here 🧐 and I trust you. If you feel that you want extra guidance I will help you out. Book a meeting with me on my calendar 📆, send me an e-mail 📧, or just show up at my desk in person 🙋‍♂️. It's my job to be there for you. Do not assume I am too busy ❌. 

### What I expect from my pool members
- **Direct talk**: I am not an Asian wizard 🧙, so don't expect that I can read the message between lines in your talk. I am totally okay with the direct talk style.
- **Invest in yourself and focus on self-improvement**: I like to have concise track record 📈 with transparency, so an up-to-date **PDB** on pool day check-in is a plus. ➕

### What you can expect of me as your pool manager
- **Flexible 1:1 pool day check-in** 📅: You are free to book in advance on which day and how often you want to meet me.
- **Transparently share context of my own goals, challenges and priorities** 💎: if you want to know, just ask me. You don't need to wonder what on earth I do all day! (If you ever do, please nudge me!)
- **Listen and hear your feedback** 📜: because that's a gift you can give me to help me improve. I know that I will make mistakes, and I'm going to make decisions that are wrong. I promise you that if you come to me and you explain to me why something is wrong, I will listen, and I will fix it.
- **Clear and direct communication** 🗨️: I am not a sophisticated Asian, so talking in high-context is not my skill. Also I don't want people to guest what I “really” think or expect people to read between the lines of what I’m saying. So that I always strive for direct talking. If it’s not clear, let me know so I can clarify or rephrase it.

## Feedback
If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories.

If you can give me this feedback in-person, I'd prefer that. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email, please do that rather than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback yourself 😳, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me and I can work on it.

If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.
