# Phuc's README

## Motivation
This documents serves as an introduction about me and my management style. I will also share my personalities applied at workplace, what I value, and what I expect from my teammates when working with me. This will help you understand me better since I've just started my journey as a manager recently. 😉
 
The primary audiences for this document are my pool members, but can be used by anyone that wants to know how I work. Feedback is welcome.

The document will be updated from time to time, or revisit when I realize that something has evolved for me.

## How to use it effectively
If you know what I believe and expect as manager, you will feel more confident that any behaviour of mine that’s not aligned is likely unintended and something I’d be eager to hear about and fix.

When it is time to give manager’s feedback, and you are wondering 🤔 _“I’m not sure whether my manager should be doing X”_. If X is in this README document, and I am not doing it, then it is something important that I'd like to heard and work on that 👋.

## My Role
Helping you grow as an individual, to achieve your goals and career path 🐣🐤🐥🎉. But my job is _not_ to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. I just give you guidance, frequently track, and give feedback the implementation made on your own.

## What I value most
- **Transparency** 💎 I will always try to be as transparent as I can with you because the less that is mysterious about me, the safer and more trusting others will feel. I am hoping you will be the same with me.
- **Privacy** 🔕 I believe people should embrace solitude to pursue their own interests rather than seeking out social activity. So I won't ask you to practice socializing or drag you into drama.
- **Ownership** 🚩 When you feel proud, or talk about your work enthusiastically, that will impress me, hence gain my respect and care.
- **Honest and direct feedback** 🗨️ We are adults, and we are here to work professionally, not as a cheerleader.

## Expectation
I won't tell you how to manage your time or how to do your work **unless** you explicitly ask for it, you are the expert here 🧐 and I trust you.

Heard a rumor? Need clarification on something? Blocked? I'd love to hear as soon as possible. Feel free to put something my calendar 📆, you don't need to ask first. If my calendar is full, send me a message 📧, or just come to my desk 🙋‍♂️. We don't need to wait for our next scheduled pool day check-in. It's my job to be there for you. Do not assume I am too busy ❌.

### What I expect from my pool members
- **Direct talk** 🗨️ I am not an Asian wizard 🧙, so don't expect that I can read the message between lines in your talk. I am totally okay with the direct talk style.
- **Invest in yourself and focus on self-improvement** 💯 I like to have concise track record 📈 with transparency, so an up-to-date **PDB** on pool day check-in is a plus. ➕
- **Disagree with me** 💥 The best solution come from a healthy level of debate, when seperating idea from ego. Come and challenge me when you don't believe in my initiatives. It's my job to make you believe. 

### What you can expect of me as your pool manager
- **Flexible 1:1 pool day check-in** 📅 You are free to book in advance on which day and how often you want to meet me.
- **Transparently share context of my own goals, challenges and priorities** 💎 if you want to know, just ask me. You don't need to wonder what on earth I do all day! (If you ever do, please nudge me!)
- **Your development** 🌟 You know best how you'd like to grow, in what areas, and the priorities. I can provide feedback, outside perspective, and learning opportunities. It's up to you to seize them. Let me know how can I help you to achieve them.
- **Listen and hear your feedback** 📜 because that's a gift you can give me to help me improve. I know that I will make mistakes, and I'm going to make decisions that are wrong. I promise you that if you come to me and you explain to me why something is wrong, I will listen, and I will fix it.
- **Clear and direct communication** 🗨️ I am not a sophisticated Asian, so talking in high-context is not my skill. Also I don't want people to guest what I “really” think or expect people to read between the lines of what I’m saying. So that I always strive for direct talking. If it’s not clear, let me know so I can clarify or rephrase it.

## Feedback
If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories.

If you can give me this feedback in-person, I'd prefer that. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email, please do that rather than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback yourself 😳, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me and I can work on it.

If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.
